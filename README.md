## These are my advent of code 2019 solutions

Initial solutions are written in C++ and I tried to structure it nicely and stuff.

EDIT: Okay I don't know how to write c++ properly; i'm pretty much just writing broken c. 
Gonna use C# instead.

EDIT 2: Now I'm just using this to learn new languages, but it's still real fun.

EDIT 3: Perhaps my c++ skill is improving. At the least, it's no longer broken c.

## Separations:

/src_cpp/ -> c++ with gcc (using wsl debian) <br>
/src_cs/ -> csharp with mono <br>
/src_c/ -> deprecated because c is unwieldy <br>
/src_rust/ -> builds are run with cargo on wsl debian (cries in profiler)<br>
/src_nim/ -> deprecated for now because nim just feels like worse rust <br>
/src_java/ -> its java, it runs anywhere -> jdk 14.0.1<br>

## Notes:

- They keep having us use the incode computers we made which I made initially in c++ and don't want to remake in c#. :\
- Okay, for day 9 I gave in and made my intcode computer nicely in c++. (To run the nice intcode computer you need the boost library for c++.)
- I figured out how to profile with rust, but I have to do it on an actual linux machine (not wsl D;) which makes it really difficult.

## TODO (languages):
- might have to save some of these until aoc2020
- maybe nim, kotlin, (a) lisp
