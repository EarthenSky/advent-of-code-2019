## This are my advent of code 2019 solutions

I wrote it in C++ and tried to structure it nicely and stuff.

Okay I don't know how to write c++ properly. it's ... a little challenging. 
Time to try using C# instead.


## Separations:

/src_cpp/ -> c++ with gcc (using wsl debian)
/src_cs/ -> csharp with mono

^w^
