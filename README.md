## These are my advent of code 2019 solutions

I wrote it in C++ and tried to structure it nicely and stuff.

EDIT: Okay I don't know how to write c++ properly; i'm pretty much just writing broken c. 
Gonna use C# instead.

EDIT 2: Now I'm just using this to learn new languages, but it's still real fun.

## Separations:

/src_cpp/ -> c++ with gcc (using wsl debian) <br>
/src_cs/ -> csharp with mono <br>
/src_c/ -> deprecated because c is unwieldy <br>
/src_rust/ -> builds are run with cargo on wsl debian (cries in profiler)<br>
/src_nim/ -> builds on wsl debian <br>

## Notes:

- They keep having us use the incode computers we made which I made initially in c++ and don't want to remake in c#. :\
- Okay, for day 9 I gave in and made my intcode computer nicely in c++. (To run the nice intcode computer you need the boost library for c++.)
- I figured out how to profile with rust, but I have to do it on an actual linux machine (not wsl D;) which makes it really difficult.
